# PopcornPicks
__Overview__

PopcornPicks is an interactive website developed by a group of movie enthusiasts who wanted to create a space where users can rate movies, read and share audience comments, reviews, and explore critics' opinions—all within a social media-like environment. Inspired by platforms like Letterboxd, Rotten Tomatoes, and X (formerly known as Twitter), PopcornPicks blends movie discussion with social interaction in a fresh and engaging way.
